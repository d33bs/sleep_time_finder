Sleep can be a fickle thing. Sleep Time Finder intends to resolve at least some of the challenges people face with sleeping by providing suggested times to wake up. This app was developed with the assistance of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as a personal demo of React.js capabilities and functionality.
